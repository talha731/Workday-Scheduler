# Workday-Scheduler
This repo is about creating  a random workday schedular for the user. This challange is about a webpage that uses Javascript, HTML and CSS to generate a workday a scheduler which would help the user organize their workday from 9 to 5. It uses the information added to the input bar and saves it on the localstorage of the browser to make sure the the input does not disapper. The user can use the save button to make that function work. The html and CSS code is given in the starter code to make the page work but the real magic is done with the help of javascript and jquery.

My motivation for this project is to make sure the I have learned the stuff taugh in the lessons. To make this project a stepping stone on my journy to a frontend developer. I build this project because I wanted to test what the knowledge that I gained from the bootcamp and apply it to a real world example.

It solves problems of keep the user organized in an extreamly busy day at work.
I learned how to use different functions, methods etc of Javascript and jquery.
